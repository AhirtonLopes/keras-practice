    "\n",
    "In a nutshell, the reason for this is that features tend to encode the spatial \"presence\" of some pattern. These are learnt/encdoded over the different tiles of the feature map (hence the term \"feature map\"). This make it much more informative to look at the maximal presence of different features than at their average presence. \n",
    "\n",
    "So the most reasonable subsampling strategy is to first produce dense maps of features (via unstrided convolutions) and then look at the maximal activation of the features over small patches, rather than looking at sparser windows of the inputs (via strided convolutions) or averaging input patches, which could cause you to miss feature presence information or dilute it."
